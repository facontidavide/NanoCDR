# NanoCDR

This single-file, header-only C++ library was created as a minimalistic replacement of
[Fast-CDR](https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-CDR).


If you don't have problem using this library, you should, because this one will only implement a
subset of that functionality.

Nevertheless, if your goal is to decode / encode **ROS2** and **DDS** messages, it might be sufficient for you.
