# NanoCDR

This single-file, header-only C++ library was created as a minimalistic replacement of
[Fast-CDR](https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-CDR).


If you don't have a problem using FastCDR, you probably should, because this one will only implement a
subset of its functionality.

Nevertheless, if your goal is to decode / encode **ROS2** and **DDS** messages, NanoCDR will work as expected.
